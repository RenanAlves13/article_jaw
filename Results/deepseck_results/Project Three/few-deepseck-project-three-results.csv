Based on the provided requirements, here is the list of microservices in CSV format:

```csv
Microservice,Responsibilities,Communicates With
Gateway,Handles HTTP requests; Serves static pages; Manages user sessions; Routes requests to appropriate services,UserService; MediaService
UserService,Handles user registration and authentication; Implements password hashing and salting,UserDatabaseService

MediaService,Processes download requests; Coordinates media operations; Forwards watermarked files to users,MediaDatabaseService; StorageService; WatermarkingService; PackagingService
MediaDatabaseService,Manages audio file metadata; Fetches lists of available audio files,Database
StorageService,Stores and retrieves audio files from physical storage,DataStorage
WatermarkingService,Digitally watermarks audio files; Re-encodes files before watermarking,ReEncoderService
ReEncoderService,Converts audio files to different bit rates,StorageService
PackagingService,Archives multiple audio files into compressed files for bulk downloads,StorageService
Database,Stores user information, salted password hashes, and audio file metadata,None
DataStorage,Represents physical storage for audio files,None
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Gateway Service**: Combines the Facade component responsibilities with API gateway patterns
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Database access is split into UserDatabaseService and MediaDatabaseService
3. **Service Boundaries**: Each major business capability (user management, media processing) gets its own service
4. **Infrastructure Services**: Database and DataStorage are treated as infrastructure components
5. **Process Flow**: MediaService acts as an orchestrator for media-related operations, coordinating between specialized services
