Here's the list of microservices derived from the modular monolith requirements:

| Microservice | Responsibilities | Communicates With |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| UserService | User registration; User authentication; Password hashing and salting | UserDBService; SessionService |
| UserDBService | Database access for user data; Create queries for user operations | Database |
| SessionService | Manage user sessions; Session validation | UserService |
| MediaCatalogService | Browse audio files; Fetch audio file metadata; Store uploaded file metadata | MediaDBService; FileStorageService; MediaProcessingService |
| MediaDBService | Database access for audio file metadata; Create queries for audio file retrieval | Database |
| FileStorageService | Store audio files; Retrieve audio files; Manage file storage | DataStorage |
| MediaProcessingService | Coordinate media operations; Process download requests; Manage media workflow | WatermarkingService; ReEncodingService; PackagingService; FileStorageService |
| WatermarkingService | Digitally watermark audio files; Re-encode files for watermarking | FileStorageService |
| ReEncodingService | Convert audio files to different bit rates; Reduce file sizes | FileStorageService |
| PackagingService | Archive multiple audio files into compressed files; Handle bulk downloads | FileStorageService |
| WebGatewayService | Serve web front end; Deliver registration/login pages; Route user requests; Forward to audio listing after login | UserService; SessionService; MediaCatalogService; MediaProcessingService |
| Database | Store user information; Store salted password hashes; Store audio file metadata | UserDBService; MediaDBService |
| DataStorage | Physical storage for audio files; File server operations | FileStorageService |

**Note:** This decomposition follows microservices principles where:
1. Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. Services are organized around business capabilities
3. Database and DataStorage are treated as external resources/services
4. Communication patterns are explicitly defined
5. The WebGatewayService acts as an API gateway/facade for the frontend
