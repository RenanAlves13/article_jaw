Based on the provided requirements, here is the list of microservices in CSV format:

```csv
Microservice,Responsibilities,Communicates With
Gateway,Server-side web front end; Delivers registration/login pages; Manages user sessions; Allows browsing/downloading/uploading; Forwards to listing page after login,UserService; MediaService
UserService,Handles user registration and authentication; Implements password hashing and salting,UserDatabaseService
UserDatabaseService,Encapsulates database access for user data; Creates queries for registration and authentication,Database
MediaService,Central business logic coordination; Processes download requests; Fetches audio files from storage; Forwards watermarked files to users,WatermarkingService; ReEncoderService; PackagingService; MediaMetadataService
WatermarkingService,Digitally watermarks audio files; Re-encodes files before watermarking,ReEncoderService; StorageService
ReEncoderService,Converts audio files to different bit rates; Reduces file sizes,StorageService
PackagingService,Archives multiple audio files into single compressed files for bulk downloads,MediaMetadataService; StorageService
MediaMetadataService,Encapsulates database access for audio file metadata; Fetches list of available audio files; Stores uploaded file metadata,AudioMetadataService; StorageService
AudioMetadataService,Creates queries to retrieve available audio files from database,Database
StorageService,Manages physical storage for audio files; Decouples audio file storage from database,None
Database,Stores user information, salted password hashes, and audio file metadata,None
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Gateway Service**: Combines Facade responsibilities with session management and routing
2. **UserService**: Focuses on authentication/registration business logic, separated from database access
3. **MediaService**: Acts as orchestrator for media-related operations
4. **Separated Concerns**: Audio metadata access separated from user data access
5. **Storage Abstraction**: StorageService provides unified interface to physical storage
6. **Database as Service**: Treated as a service for consistency, though in practice might be shared infrastructure

Note: The "Communicates With" column shows direct service-to-service communication. In a real implementation, you might use message queues or event-driven patterns for some interactions (particularly between MediaService and its dependent services).
