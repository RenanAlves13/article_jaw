Based on the modular monolith requirements, here's the microservices decomposition in CSV format:

```csv
Microservice,Responsibilities,Communicates With
UserService,User registration; User authentication; Password hashing and salting; Session management,DatabaseService; GatewayService
GatewayService,Web frontend delivery; Session management; Request routing; User redirection after login,UserService; MediaService; FileStorageService
MediaService,Audio file listing; Download request processing; Upload coordination; Business logic orchestration,UserService; FileStorageService; WatermarkService; PackagingService; DatabaseService
WatermarkService,Audio file watermarking; Audio file re-encoding,MediaService; FileStorageService
PackagingService,Archive creation for bulk downloads; File compression,MediaService; FileStorageService
FileStorageService,Audio file storage; File retrieval; File upload handling,MediaService; WatermarkService; PackagingService
DatabaseService,User data storage; Audio metadata storage; Query execution,UserService; MediaService
```

**Key decomposition rationale:**
1. **UserService** combines UserManagement and UserDBAdapter responsibilities
2. **GatewayService** handles Facade component responsibilities
3. **MediaService** centralizes MediaManagement and MediaAccess logic
4. **FileStorageService** handles DataStorage and AudioAccess responsibilities
5. **DatabaseService** maintains database abstraction
6. **WatermarkService** and **PackagingService** are specialized services for their specific domains

This decomposition follows domain-driven design principles, with each service having clear bounded contexts and well-defined communication patterns.
