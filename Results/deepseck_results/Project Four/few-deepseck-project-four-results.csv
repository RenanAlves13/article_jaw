Based on the provided requirements, here is the list of microservices in CSV format:

```csv
Microservice,Responsibilities,Communicates With
Gateway,Server-side web front end; Delivers registration/login pages; Manages user sessions; Routes requests to backend services,UserService; MediaService
UserService,Handles user registration and authentication; Implements password hashing and salting; Manages user data access,Database; Gateway
MediaService,Coordinates media operations; Processes download requests; Manages audio file browsing and uploads,UserService; WatermarkService; ReEncoderService; PackagingService; MediaMetadataService; StorageService
WatermarkService,Digitally watermarks audio files; Re-encodes files before watermarking,MediaService; StorageService
ReEncoderService,Converts audio files to different bit rates,MediaService; StorageService
PackagingService,Archives multiple audio files into compressed files for bulk downloads,MediaService; StorageService
MediaMetadataService,Manages audio file metadata; Fetches lists of available audio files; Handles metadata database access,Database; MediaService
StorageService,Manages physical storage of audio files; Handles file uploads and downloads,MediaService; WatermarkService; ReEncoderService; PackagingService
Database,Stores user information; Stores salted password hashes; Stores audio file metadata,UserService; MediaMetadataService
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Gateway Service**: Combines the Facade component responsibilities with API gateway patterns for routing and session management.

2. **User Service**: Consolidates UserManagement and UserDBAdapter responsibilities into a single service handling all user-related operations.

3. **Media Service**: Acts as the orchestrator for media operations, replacing the MediaManagement component with a service that coordinates between specialized media processing services.

4. **Specialized Processing Services**: Watermarking, Re-encoding, and Packaging are separate services to allow independent scaling based on processing load.

5. **Media Metadata Service**: Separates metadata management from file storage operations for better data organization and query optimization.

6. **Storage Service**: Abstracts the DataStorage component into a service that handles all file storage operations.

7. **Database**: Treated as a shared resource/service that multiple services can access for their specific data needs.

This decomposition follows domain-driven design principles, separates concerns effectively, and allows for independent scaling of compute-intensive services (like Watermarking and Re-encoding) from user-facing services.
