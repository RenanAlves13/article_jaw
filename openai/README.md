# openai

This folder contains notebooks related to using OpenAI models to generate architecture artifacts.

## Contents

- Notebooks and/or scripts specific to running with the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (or your notebook environment).
- OpenAI API key configured (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## How to use

1. Open the notebook in your IDE (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter, or Colab).
2. Ensure the environment variable with your key is available:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```
3. Run the cells in order.

## Notes

- The environment variable name may vary by notebook. Adjust as needed.
- If you are not using the notebooks, you do not need to configure the API key to run `analise.py`.
